Part1
	unzip a couple of times to get flag

Part2
	one of the .jpg actually has two zip files appended at the end
	use foremost/binwalk to extract the second zip
	keep unziping to get flag

Part3
	text fused into image, some stego tools may help reveal plaintext
	a simple proof-of-work script is shown below

		from PIL import Image
		import numpy as np
		img = np.array(Image.open('cat8.jpg'))
		img[img<45]=255
		img = Image.fromarray(img)
		img.save('img.png')
