If you look closely, you can notice that cookie "user" changes as you login with differrent accounts
Moreover, the values seem like some kind of indexing(test1->1, test2->2)

However, changing the value of "user" doesn't have any affect on login
Thus, we suspect there might be a breach in the change password part

After Logging in to test1, set "user"=2, then change password, we notice that the password for test2 has changed
Thus, it is apparent that password update is done by using "user" cookie as some kind of index

Fuzzing for user value of account M30W is easy
And we can finally discover M30W is at index 3, change its password, then login to get flag
