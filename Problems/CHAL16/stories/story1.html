<h2>Obluda, Která Nemá Své Jméno</h2>
<h2>The Monster Who Didn't Have A Name</h2>
<img src='/css_sr/nameless_monster.jpg'>
<p>Once upon a time, in a land far away, there lived a nameless monster.
</p><p>The monster was dying to have a name.
</p><p>So the monster made up his mind, and set out on a journey to look for one.
</p><p>But the world was such a very large place.
</p><p>The monster split in two, and went on separate journeys.
</p><p>One went east.
</p><p>The other headed west.
</p><p>The one who went east came upon a village.
</p><p>There was a blacksmith who lived at the village's entrance.
</p><p>"Mr. Blacksmith, please give me your name!" said the monster.
</p><p>"I can't give you my name!" replied the blacksmith.
</p><p>'If you give me your name, I'll go inside you and make you strong," said the monster.
</p><p>"Really?" said the blacksmith, "If you make me stronger, I'll give you my name."
</p><p>The monster went into the blacksmith.
</p><p>And so, the monster became Otto the blacksmith.
</p><p>Otto was the strongest man in town.
</p><p>But then one day he said, "Look at me! Look at me! The monster inside of me is getting bigger!"
</p><p>Munch munch, chomp chomp, gobble gobble, gulp.
</p><p>The hungry monster ate up Otto from the inside out.
</p><p>Once again, he was a monster without a name.
</p><p>Next, he went into Hans the shoemaker.
</p><p>However...
</p><p>Munch munch, chomp chomp, gobble gobble, gulp.
</p><p>Once again, he went back to being a monster without a name.
</p><p>Then, he became Thomas the hunter.
</p><p>But soon...
</p><p>Munch munch, chomp chomp, gobble gobble, gulp.
</p><p>Back he went to being a monster without a name.
</p><p>The monster next went to a castle to look for a nice name.
</p><p>He came upon a very sick boy who lived in that castle.
</p><p>"If you give me your name, I'll make you strong," said the monster.
</p><p>The boy replied, "If you can make me healthy and strong, I will give you my name!"
</p><p>So the monster jumped right into the boy.
</p><p>And the boy became full of vigor.
</p><p>The king was overjoyed.
</p><p>He announced, "The prince is healthy! The prince is strong!"
</p><p>The monster became quite fond of the boy's name.
</p><p>He was also quite pleased with his royal life in the castle.
</p><p>So he controlled himself no matter how ravenous his appetite became.
</p><p>Day after day, despite his growing hunger, the monster stayed put inside the boy.
</p><p>But finally, the hunger just became too great...
</p><p>"Look at me! Look at me!" said the boy, "The monster inside of me has gotten this big!"
</p><p>The boy devoured the king and all his servants.
</p><p>Munch munch, chomp chomp, gobble gobble, gulp.
</p><p>The castle was lonely now with everyone gone, so the boy left on a journey.
</p><p>He walked and walked for days.
</p><p>And then one day, the boy came upon the monster who had gone west.
</p><p>"I have a name!" said the boy, "And it's such a wonderful one at that!"
</p><p>But the monster who went west replied, "Who needs a name? I'm perfectly happy without one. After all, that's what we are - nameless monsters."
</p><p>The boy ate up the monster who went west.
</p><p>At last he had found a name, but there was no longer anyone to call him by it.
</p><p>Such a shame, because Johan was such a wonderful name.
