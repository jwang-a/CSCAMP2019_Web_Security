<h2>The Monster’s Love Letter to the Woman</h2>
<img src='/css_sr/drawing.jpg'>
<p>I’ve always been watching you.</p>
<p>I’ve been watching you, to take in everything about you.</p>
<p>But instead, everything about you has devoured me.</p>
<p>How did I seem to you on the verge of my downfall?</p>
<p>What you gave to me as I crashed... You left me with beautiful jewels.</p>
<p>Those two eternal twins.</p>
<p>The greatest crime one can commit is to take away another’s name.</p>
<p>You may have your name back.</p>
<p>I return your name to you.</p>
<p>Your name is Anna… Now, I am only sad.</p>
<p>Sad.</p>
<p>Sad.</p>
<p>Sad.</p>
