The man with the big mouth cried and cried in the garden that never grew again.<br />“I shouldn’t have made a deal with the demon!”<br />The man with the big eyes was dying from hunger. Tears were trickling down from his big eyes as he cried out.<br />“I should have made a deal with the demon.”<br />“Let’s make make a deal! Let’s make a deal!” said the demon.
