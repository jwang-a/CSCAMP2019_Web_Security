<h2>Dívka Hledání</h2>
<h2>The Girl's Journey</h2>
<img src='/css_sr/girl.jpg'>
<p>I am a girl who’s lost her memory.
</p><p>I had that I was being chased by a monster.
</p><p>I had a dream I was chasing a monster.
</p><p>But I like to sing.
</p><p>I like to dance, too.
</p><p>Someday, I have a wonderful dream…
</p><p>Someday, that dream will come true for me.
</p><p>Someday…Someday….
</p><p><br />
</p><p>The girl made up her mind to leave.
</p><p>She doesn’t know what kind of a journey it will be.
</p><p>She doesn’t know what is waiting for her.
</p><p>But, the girl will courageously continue her journey.
</p><p>The girl turns and waves her hand again and again.
</p><p>Again…and again….
</p><p>And then she is gone.
</p><p>To search for her happy ending.
